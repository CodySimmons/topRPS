The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissor project

Rock Paper Scissors with a graphical interface.
Displays buttons for player to select for move they'll page,
the current games score, and a reset button when a player reaches 5
wins.

What I learned:
How to select elements from a html page and add new children to them.
How to manipulate elements and assign values, css text, or remove them from the DOM
Using an event listener to see when a user clicks a button, and starting actions.
Using a querySelectorAll to select all elements of a certain class, and setting them up as a group instead of individually.
